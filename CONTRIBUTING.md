# Bugs, Enhancements and Missing Features

There are lots of these. Use the issue tracker on github.

I can't promise all features will be implemented nor all bugs fixed, but there are quite a few places where things could be improvied. 

Please remember that this software was build to explore ideas so things such as security, logins etc where not considered.

# Thanks

Huge thanks to anyone who provides feedback!

# Getting Help

Github issue tracker would be the best place - We'll be reading this fairly often. If things need more discussion then we can move to email on a case-by-case basis.
